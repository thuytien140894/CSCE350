Ensure the makefile, Main.cpp, and Main.h are in the same directory.

In the directory with those files, create a directory called "data" (all lowercase).
In this folder, place all 141 query files and all 47 template files.

To compile the program, go to the directory containing the makefile and run the command "make".
This will compile the program and generate a file named "Aprog".

To execute the program after compiling, run the command "./Aprog".

The output of the ten closest neighbors for each query file is stored in the "log.txt" file generated by running the program.
